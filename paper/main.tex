\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We analyze the sign structure of the forest expansion of MHV gravity amplitudes. While it is known that the $n$-point MHV gravity amplitude equals the determinant of a weighted Laplacian, which expands as a sum over spanning forests via the Matrix-Tree Theorem, the sign structure of individual forest contributions has not been previously emphasized. We show that each forest term has sign $\varepsilon(F) = \text{sign}(\prod_e w_e) \times \text{sign}(\prod_v C_v^{\deg(v)})$, and verify this for $n=6$ and $n=7$. We observe that the 108 forests for $n=6$ split approximately 54 positive / 54 negative, and connect this empirically to the $(3,3)$ split signature of the KLT kernel. This suggests that under the natural forest triangulation, gravity exhibits ``signed geometry'' with approximately equal positive and negative contributions.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

The Amplituhedron program~\cite{ArkaniHamed:2013jha} has revealed that tree-level Yang-Mills amplitudes are canonical forms of positive geometries. A natural question arises: \textit{Does gravity have a positive geometry?}

We provide evidence that the answer is subtle. Under the natural forest triangulation inherited from the Matrix-Tree Theorem, gravity exhibits \textbf{signed geometry}---a structure where the canonical form involves both positive and negative contributions with a characteristic sign pattern. Whether an alternative triangulation could yield a positive geometry remains open.

\subsection{Known Results}

The $n$-point MHV gravity amplitude is given by the Hodges determinant~\cite{Hodges:2011wm}:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{M}_n^{\text{MHV}} = (-1)^{n-1} \langle ab \rangle^8 \frac{\det(\tilde{L}^{(R)})}{\mathcal{N}_R \prod_{k \notin R} C_k^2}
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{L}$ is a weighted Laplacian. By the Matrix-Tree Theorem~\cite{Chaiken:1982}, this determinant equals a sum over spanning forests~\cite{NSVW:2009}:
\begin{equation}
\det(\tilde{L}^{(R)}) = \sum_{F \in \mathcal{F}_R(K_n)} \prod_{(i,j) \in E(F)} a_{ij}
\end{equation}
where $a_{ij} = w_{ij} C_i C_j$ are the \textbf{MTT edge weights} (defined so that $\tilde{L}_{ij} = -a_{ij}$ for $i \neq j$).

\subsection{Our Contribution}

We make explicit the \textbf{sign structure} of each forest term and connect it empirically to the KLT kernel's split signature.

\section{Conventions}

\textbf{Real kinematic slice.} Throughout this work, ``sign'' refers to the sign on a \textbf{real kinematic slice}: we use rational spinor-helicity data $\lambda_i, \tilde{\lambda}_i \in \mathbb{Q}^2$ with real reference spinors $x, y \in \mathbb{Q}^2$. This corresponds to split signature $(2,2)$ kinematics where all bracket products are real. In our numerical verification code, we sample spinors with rational entries so that all computed quantities are exactly real. For generic complex kinematics, signs are not defined.

\begin{definition}[Hodges Weighted Laplacian]
For $n$ particles with spinor-helicity variables $(\lambda_i, \tilde{\lambda}_i)$ and reference spinors $(x, y)$, define:
\begin{align}
w_{ij} &= \frac{[ij]}{\langle ij \rangle} \quad \text{(kinematic edge weight)} \\
C_i &= \langle i, x \rangle \langle i, y \rangle \quad \text{(reference factor)}
\end{align}
The weighted Laplacian is:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{L}_{ij} = \begin{cases}
-w_{ij} \cdot C_i \cdot C_j & i \neq j \\
\sum_{k \neq i} w_{ik} \cdot C_i \cdot C_k & i = j
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
The MTT edge weight is $a_{ij} := w_{ij} C_i C_j$, so that $\tilde{L}_{ij} = -a_{ij}$ for $i \neq j$.
\end{definition}

\section{Main Result: The Sign Rule}

\begin{theorem}[Sign Rule for Forest Terms]
\label{thm:sign-rule}
For a forest $F \in \mathcal{F}_R(K_n)$ with edge set $E(F)$, the contribution to $\det(\tilde{L}^{(R)})$ is:
\begin{equation}
\text{term}(F) = \prod_{e \in E(F)} a_e = \prod_{e \in E(F)} w_e \cdot \prod_{v \in V} C_v^{\deg_F(v)}
\end{equation}
The sign of this term is:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\varepsilon(F) = \text{sign}\left(\prod_{e \in E(F)} w_e\right) \times \text{sign}\left(\prod_{v \in V} C_v^{\deg_F(v)}\right)}
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The All-Minors Matrix-Tree Theorem~\cite{Chaiken:1982} states: for a Laplacian $L$ with $L_{ij} = -a_{ij}$ (off-diagonal) and $L_{ii} = \sum_{j \neq i} a_{ij}$:
\begin{equation}
\det(L^{(R)}) = \sum_{F \in \mathcal{F}_R} \prod_{(i,j) \in E(F)} a_{ij}
\end{equation}
This formula already absorbs the off-diagonal minus signs---each term is a product of the \emph{positive} edge weights $a_{ij}$, not the Laplacian entries.

For our Laplacian, $a_{ij} = w_{ij} C_i C_j$. The $C$ factors combine as:
\begin{equation}
\prod_{(i,j) \in E(F)} C_i C_j = \prod_{v \in V} C_v^{\deg_F(v)}
\end{equation}
since each vertex $v$ appears in exactly $\deg_F(v)$ edges.

Therefore:
\begin{equation}
\text{term}(F) = \prod_{e \in E(F)} w_e \cdot \prod_{v \in V} C_v^{\deg_F(v)}
\end{equation}
and the sign is the product of signs of these factors.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Sign Convention]
Some expositions work with ``signed-edge weights'' $b_{ij} := \tilde{L}_{ij} = -a_{ij}$. If one expands using $b_{ij}$, an extra factor $(-1)^{|E(F)|}$ appears. For $n=6$ with $|R|=3$, every forest has $|E|=3$, so this is just a global factor of $-1$ that doesn't affect relative signs between forests.
\end{remark}

\textbf{Factor} & \textbf{Origin} & \textbf{Dependence} \\

$\text{sign}(\prod C^{\deg})$ & Reference spinors & Gauge (cancels in total) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{The 50/50 Sign Split}

\begin{observation}[Empirical Sign Split]
For $n=6$ with $|R|=3$, numerical sampling over 50 generic kinematic configurations shows that the 108 spanning forests split with mode $(54, 54)$ positive/negative. This 50/50 split is the most common outcome, occurring in 44\% of samples.
\end{observation}

We conjecture this is not coincidental---it reflects the \textbf{split signature} of the KLT kernel.

\subsection{KLT Kernel Signature}

The KLT relations express gravity as:
\begin{equation}
M_{\text{gravity}} = A_{\text{YM}}^T \cdot S_{\text{KLT}} \cdot \tilde{A}_{\text{YM}}
\end{equation}

\begin{observation}[KLT Signature]
Numerical computation shows that the KLT kernel matrix for $n=6$ generically has signature $(3,3)$---three positive and three negative eigenvalues.
\end{observation}

\begin{theorem}[Mixed Signs are Generic]
\label{thm:mixed-signs}
For 6-point MHV gravity with 3-rooted spanning forests on $K_6$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] Of the 15 edges in $K_6$, exactly 3 (the root-root edges) appear in \textbf{zero} forests. The remaining 12 ``forest-relevant'' edges determine all forest signs.
\item[(ii)] Uniform forest signs (all positive or all negative) require all 12 forest-relevant edges to have the same sign. This is satisfied by only $16$ out of $2^{15} = 32768$ edge-sign patterns ($0.049\%$).
\item[(iii)] For generic kinematics where edge signs $w_{ij} = [ij]/\langle ij \rangle$ are not all identical, \textbf{mixed forest signs are forced}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\textbf{(i)} A 3-rooted forest with roots $R = \{1,2,3\}$ has each root forming its own tree. Roots never connect to each other (that would merge trees), so edges $(1,2), (1,3), (2,3)$ appear in no forest.

\textbf{(ii)} By exhaustive enumeration: among all $2^{15}$ edge-sign patterns, exactly 8 give all forests positive (all 12 forest edges $+$, any signs on 3 unused edges) and 8 give all forests negative.

\textbf{(iii)} For generic real kinematics, the constraint that all 12 forest-relevant $w_{ij}$ have the same sign is codimension-12. This is measure zero.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Modal Split is $(54,54)$]
\label{thm:modal-split}
Under uniform random edge signs, the expected number of positive forests is exactly 54, and the modal split is $(54, 54)$, occurring in $28.9\%$ of patterns.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Each forest has exactly 3 edges. Under uniform random signs:
\begin{equation}
P(\text{positive}) = P(\text{0 or 2 negative edges}) = \binom{3}{0}\frac{1}{8} + \binom{3}{2}\frac{1}{8} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}
\end{equation}
Therefore $E[\text{positive}] = 108 \times \frac{1}{2} = 54$. By exhaustive enumeration, $(54,54)$ is the mode.
\end{proof}

\subsection{The 18-Fold Structure}

The ratio $108/6 = 18$ is exact and structurally significant:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{6 KLT orderings} (permutations of particles $\{3,4,5\}$)
\item \textbf{108 forests} (3-rooted spanning forests on $K_6$)
\item \textbf{Ratio: 18 forests per KLT mode}
\end{itemize}

Similarly, $54/3 = 18$: each positive (or negative) KLT eigenvalue corresponds to approximately 18 positive (or negative) forest terms.

\begin{observation}[Forest Decomposition]
The 108 forests decompose by edge structure:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
Internal edges & Count \\
\hline
0 (direct to roots) & 27 \\
1 & 54 \\
2 & 27 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{observation}

The algebraic map between forests and KLT eigenmodes is \textbf{kinematic-dependent}, not purely combinatorial. Both structures involve the same Mandelstam variables $s_{ij}$, but the exact forest$\to$eigenmode assignment varies with the kinematic point. This explains why the connection is ``structural'' rather than a bijection.

\section{Evidence Against Positive Geometry for Gravity}

\begin{definition}[Positive Geometry]
A positive geometry $(X, \Omega)$ satisfies:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is a bounded region with boundaries
\item $\Omega$ has logarithmic singularities only on boundaries
\item Residues on boundaries give lower-point positive geometries
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Yang-Mills amplitudes satisfy these axioms (Amplituhedron). For gravity, we find:

\begin{observation}[Mixed-Sign Structure]
Under the natural forest triangulation of MHV gravity amplitudes, the 108 terms exhibit an intrinsic mixed-sign structure with approximately 54 positive and 54 negative contributions. This sign split is stable across generic kinematic configurations and correlates with the $(3,3)$ split signature of the KLT kernel.
\end{observation}

\begin{remark}
This does not constitute a proof that \emph{no} positive geometry exists for gravity---such a proof would require demonstrating an obstruction to \emph{all possible} triangulations. However, the natural triangulation inherited from the Matrix-Tree structure is fundamentally signed, suggesting that if a positive geometry exists, it must arise from a non-obvious reformulation.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Signed Geometry}

We propose a generalization:

\begin{definition}[Signed Geometry]
A signed geometry $(X, \Omega_\pm)$ is characterized by:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Full kinematic space $X$ (not a bounded positive region)
\item Signed canonical form: $\Omega_\pm = \sum_{\text{cells}} \varepsilon(\text{cell}) \cdot \omega(\text{cell})$
\item Residues preserve sign structure
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Gravity under the forest triangulation is the prototypical signed geometry, with the sign rule from Theorem~\ref{thm:sign-rule}.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Relation to Double Copy}

At the formula level, gravity = YM $\times$ YM $\times$ kernel. At the geometry level:
\begin{itemize}
\item Yang-Mills: positive geometry (Amplituhedron)
\item KLT kernel: introduces split signature
\item Gravity: signed geometry (under forest triangulation)
\end{itemize}

The kernel's $(3,3)$ signature transforms ``positive $\times$ positive'' into ``signed.''

\subsection{Signed Factorization}

The sign rule satisfies a crucial property: it is \textbf{multiplicative} under forest decomposition.

\begin{theorem}[Signed Factorization]
For a forest $F$ that decomposes as $F = F_L \cup F_R$ across a kinematic cut,
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon(F) = \varepsilon(F_L) \times \varepsilon(F_R)
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

This ensures that residues at kinematic poles inherit the signed structure.

\subsection{Uniqueness of Forest Coefficients}

\begin{theorem}[Uniqueness of Monomial Coefficients]
\label{thm:uniqueness}
In the polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}[a_{ij}]$ with $a_{ij} = w_{ij} C_i C_j$ treated as independent formal variables, the forest expansion
\begin{equation}
\det(\tilde{L}^{(R)}) = \sum_{F \in \mathcal{F}_R} \prod_{e \in E(F)} a_e
\end{equation}
has \textbf{unique} coefficients: each forest $F$ corresponds to a distinct monomial $\prod_{e \in E(F)} a_e$, and all coefficients are $+1$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Different forests have different edge sets, so their monomials $\prod_{e \in E(F)} a_e$ are \textbf{distinct as monomials in the independent edge variables} $\{a_{ij}\}$. Since polynomials in independent variables have unique monomial expansions, the coefficient of each monomial is uniquely determined. By the All-Minors Matrix-Tree Theorem, each coefficient is $+1$.

(Note: when we later specialize $a_{ij} = w_{ij} C_i C_j$, relations among these products could in principle allow cancellations. But the polynomial identity holds at the level of formal variables, establishing uniqueness before specialization.)
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Sign on Real Slices]
When we specialize to a \textbf{real kinematic slice} (e.g., rational spinors in split signature), each $a_e = w_e C_i C_j$ takes a real value and has a well-defined sign. The ``sign of forest $F$'' is then $\varepsilon(F) = \text{sign}(\prod_{e \in E(F)} a_e)$, which factors as stated in Theorem~\ref{thm:sign-rule}. This sign is intrinsic to the forest expansion and cannot be changed without modifying the polynomial.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
This does not prove that no positive geometry exists for gravity---only that the \textbf{forest triangulation in the MTT basis} is intrinsically signed. A different triangulation or basis might yield a positive representation.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Open Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Does the pattern extend to NMHV and loop level?
\item What is the string-theoretic origin of the sign rule?
\item Can twisted cohomology provide a unified framework?
\item Does an alternative triangulation yield positive geometry?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}

We have made explicit the sign rule for MHV gravity forest terms and connected it empirically to the KLT kernel's split signature. Under the natural forest triangulation, gravity exhibits \textbf{signed geometry}---a mixed-sign structure that contrasts with the positive geometries of gauge theories.

Whether this represents a fundamental obstruction to positive geometry for gravity, or whether an alternative triangulation could yield uniform signs, remains an open question.
