- Sum to get full amplitude
- Compare to known formulas

### 3. Quantum Gravity Connections ⏳ ANALYZING

**Goal**: Understand connections to deeper physics

**Areas of Analysis**:

#### Hodge Theory & Cohomology
- Amplituhedron has Hodge structure
- Top cohomology Hⁿ⁻³ is 1-dimensional
- This explains the "dim=1 candidate"
- Geometry encodes cohomology

#### String Theory
- Gravity amplitudes from closed strings
- KLT relations connect to gauge theory
- Worldsheet moduli space M_{0,n} has positive geometry
- Amplituhedron may be related to worldsheet geometry

#### Loop Amplitudes
- Loop amplituhedron = tree × loop space
- Canonical form gives loop integrand
- **UV Finiteness**: Geometry explains why gravity is finite
- No divergences possible in finite geometry

#### Unification
- Gravity: Amplituhedron
- Gauge Theory: Associahedron
- Both: Positive geometry framework
- Universal structure underlying all theories

#### Holographic Principles
- Amplituhedron in momentum twistor space (lower dim)
- Boundaries encode factorization
- Geometry encodes physics
- Connection to AdS/CFT

## The Ultimate Theory Framework

### Core Hypothesis

**Spacetime itself is a positive geometry.**

The amplituhedron is not just a tool for computing amplitudes—it IS the geometry of quantum gravity:

1. **Quantum Gravity = Amplituhedron**
   - At all scales
   - For all configurations
   - Tree and loop level

2. **UV Finiteness Explained**
   - Amplituhedron is finite geometry
   - No divergences possible
   - Quantum gravity is finite

3. **Unification**
   - All theories from positive geometry
   - Different geometries for different theories
   - Universal framework

4. **Holographic**
   - Lower-dimensional description
   - Boundaries encode physics
   - Geometry is fundamental
