## 4. Novelty Claim
This work identifies the **3-Rooted Spanning Forest Polytope** (a specific generalized permutohedron) as the geometric object underlying the $n$-point MHV gravity amplitude. While the Spanning Tree polytope corresponds to the "cleared" numerator, the physical amplitude is a specific **minor** (forest sum) normalized by the CHY measure.
