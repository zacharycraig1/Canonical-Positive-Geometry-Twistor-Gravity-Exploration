## Title
**Gravity from Geometry: The Forest Polytope and Canonical Forms**

## Abstract
We demonstrate that tree-level MHV gravity amplitudes are generated by the canonical form of a specific positive geometry: the 3-Rooted Spanning Forest Polytope of the complete graph. This generalizes the Amplituhedron (YM) and Associahedron (Scalars) to Gravity, revealing a hidden "Forest" structure.

## 1. Introduction
- The search for geometric formulations of scattering amplitudes (Amplituhedron, etc.).
- Gravity as the "square" of gauge theory (KLT) vs geometric unification.
- Summary of result: Gravity = Canonical Form of Forest Polytope.

## 2. The Forest Polytope
- **Definition**: The Newton polytope of the 3-rooted spanning forest polynomial.
- **Vertices**: Characteristic vectors of forests with roots $R=\{r_1, r_2, r_3\}$.
- **Facets**: Correspond to compatible sub-forests (factorization channels).

## 3. Main Theorems

### Theorem 1 (The Forest Formula)
The MHV Gravity amplitude $M_n(1, \dots, n)$ is given by:
\[
M_n = (-1)^{n-1} \langle 01 \rangle^8 \frac{F_{n,R}(z_{ij})}{N_R \prod_{k \notin R} C_k^2}
\]
where $F_{n,R}$ is the forest polynomial evaluated on edge variables $z_{ij}$.

### Theorem 2 (Pushforward / Duality)
The function $F_{n,R}(z)$ defines the canonical form of the **dual** Forest Polytope $P^*$.
\[
\Omega(P^*) = F_{n,R}(z) \, d^N z
\]
Thus, the amplitude is the canonical form of the dual polytope (up to prefactors).

### Theorem 3 (Factorization)
The facets of $P_{n,R}$ correspond to poles of the amplitude.
- Boundaries where $z_{ij} \to \infty$ correspond to factorization channels $s_I \to 0$.
- The residue on a facet is the product of lower-point canonical forms (Unitarity).

## 4. n=6 Verification
- Exact rational verification for n=6.
- Demonstration of gauge invariance (independence of reference spinors).
- Numerical verification of double-pole factorization behavior.

## 5. Known Results & Context
- **Matrix-Tree Theorem**: Our formula is consistent with Hodges/NSVW via Chaiken's Matrix-Tree Theorem (All-Minors).
- **Stringy Canonical Forms**: Our $F(z)$ construction aligns with the definition of "Stringy Canonical Forms" for Newton Polytopes.

## 6. Conclusion
- The "Gravituhedron" in this sector is a Forest Polytope.
- Future work: NMHV, loop level.
