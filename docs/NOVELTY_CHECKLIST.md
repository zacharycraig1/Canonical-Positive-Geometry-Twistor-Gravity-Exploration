# Novelty Audit Checklist

## 1. Known Results (Do Not Claim as New)

- **Hodges Determinant Formula**: The expression of MHV gravity amplitudes as a reduced determinant of a "Laplacian" matrix $\Phi$.
  - *Reference*: A. Hodges, arXiv:1108.2227.
- **Tree/Forest Expansion of Determinants**: The mathematical identity relating reduced determinants of Laplacian matrices to sums over trees/forests (Matrix-Tree Theorem and generalizations).
  - *Reference*: B. Feng, S. He, arXiv:1207.3220; S. Chaiken, SIAM J. Alg. Disc. Meth. 3 (1982).
- **KLT Relations**: The expression of Gravity amplitudes as squares of Gauge theory amplitudes.
  - *Reference*: Kawai, Lewellen, Tye (1986); Bern et al (1998).
- **MHV Gravity Tree Formula**: Specific explicit formula for MHV gravity using tree diagrams.
  - *Reference*: Nguyen et al, arXiv:0907.2276.

## 2. Potential Novelty (The "Pushforward" Claim)

- **Candidate Claim**: The interpretation of the "Forest Polynomial" (denominator of the Hodges form) as a **canonical form** on a specific **Positive Geometry** (the "Forest Polytope"), and the amplitude as the **pushforward** of this form to kinematic space.
- **Comparison Needed**:
  - *Arkani-Hamed et al (2021)*: Discusses "stringy canonical forms" and pushforwards. We must differentiate our polytope/map from theirs.
  - *ABHY (2017)*: Associates amplitudes with Associahedra/Stokes Polytopes. Our "Forest Polytope" (generalized permutohedron) might be distinct or a specific case.
  
## 3. Action Items for Publication
- [ ] Explicitly define the "Forest Polytope" $P_F$ by inequalities.
- [ ] Explicitly define the map $\Phi: \mathcal{K} \to P_F$ (or related space).
- [ ] Prove that $\Omega(P_F)$ pushes forward to $M_{MHV}$.
- [ ] If this maps exactly to the Nguyen/Feng-He formula, the novelty is purely the **geometric interpretation** (pushforward structure), not the formula itself.
