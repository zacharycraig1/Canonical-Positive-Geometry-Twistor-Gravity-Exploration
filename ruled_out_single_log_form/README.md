# Ruled Out: Single Logarithmic Form for 6-Point MHV Gravity

This directory contains the code and logs for the attempt to describe the 6-point MHV gravity amplitude as a single $S_6$-invariant logarithmic differential form on $M_{0,6}$.

## Conclusion
**Negative Result.**
There is no single $S_6$-invariant differential form on the moduli space $M_{0,6}$ that is both logarithmic on all boundaries and satisfies the required physical constraints (factorization and projectivity).
