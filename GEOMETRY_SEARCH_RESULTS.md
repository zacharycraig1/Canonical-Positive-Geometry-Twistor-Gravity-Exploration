# Geometry Search Results

## Executive Summary

The systematic geometry search revealed a **fundamental issue**: the scattering equation solutions do NOT lie in any simple positivity region as assumed by the directive.

## Key Findings

### 1. Solutions Have Different Orderings

| Solutions | Ordering |
|-----------|----------|
| 1, 3 | z5 > z6 > z4 |
| 2 | z5 > z4 > z6 |
| 4 | z4 > z6 > z5 |
| 5, 6 | z6 > z4 > z5 |

**None of the 6 orderings is z4 > z5 > z6** as assumed in Option B1!

### 2. Solutions Have Mixed Signs

| Solution | z4 | z5 | z6 |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|
| 1 | -0.039 | +0.026 | +0.013 |
| 2 | +0.042 | +0.537 | -0.101 |
| 3 | -1.176 | +2.362 | +0.261 |
| 4 | +2.899 | -13.444 | +0.434 |
| 5 | -0.003 | -0.003 | -0.001 |
| 6 | -0.003 | -0.003 | -0.001 |

**No solution has all positive z4, z5, z6!**

### 3. B-Option Results

| Option | Description | Solutions in Region |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| B1 | z4 > z5 > z6 > 0 | 0 |
| B2 | Pf'(Ψ) > 0 | 4 |
| B3 | Total positivity | 0 |
| B4 | i*Ψ is PSD | 0 |

**Option B2 is closest** but still only captures 4 of 6 solutions.

## Implications

### The Directive's Assumption May Be Incomplete

The directive (lines 372-379) assumes:
```
The "positive" region of M_{0,n} is typically:
    0 < z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n < ∞
```

But with gauge fixing (z1, z2, z3) = (0, 1, ∞):
- z4, z5, z6 are NOT all in (0, 1)
- They can be negative or greater than 1
- The "positive" region in M_{0,6} is more complex

### Possible Resolutions

1. **Union of Regions**: R6 might be a union of all 6 ordering regions, not just one

2. **Complex Solutions**: MHV might inherently involve complex z-values, with real kinematics arising from sum over solutions

3. **Different Gauge**: Perhaps a different gauge fixing reveals simpler structure

4. **Projectivized Coordinates**: The positive region might be defined in terms of cross-ratios or other gauge-invariant combinations

5. **CHY Is The Answer**: The CHY formula (sum over all solutions) might BE the "positive geometry" without a simple positivity interpretation

## What This Means for the Project

### The Good News
- We successfully tested all four options systematically
- We found the scattering solutions correctly (6 solutions, 6 real)
- The CHY machinery works

### The Challenge
- The simple positivity conditions B1-B4 don't capture the geometry
- The positive geometry for gravity MHV may not be as simple as for amplituhedron
- More sophisticated analysis is needed

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Study the Literature**: Review papers on positive geometry for gravity specifically
   - Arkani-Hamed, Trnka on amplituhedron (for gluons)
   - Specific papers on gravity positive geometry (if they exist)

2. **Test Different Gauges**: Try fixing (z1, z2, z3) = (∞, 0, 1) or other orderings

3. **Cross-Ratio Analysis**: Define positivity in gauge-invariant quantities

4. **Sum Over Orderings**: Perhaps the "canonical form" requires summing over all 6 ordered regions

5. **Contact Experts**: This might be an open research problem

```

## Conclusion

**The systematic search was successful in revealing that simple positivity conditions do not define the gravity MHV geometry.** This is a valuable negative result that redirects the investigation toward more sophisticated geometric structures.

The CHY formula works by summing over ALL solutions, not by restricting to a positive region. This suggests the "positive geometry" interpretation for gravity may require a fundamentally different approach than the amplituhedron.
